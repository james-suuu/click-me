Hey [My fav person],

I hope you're doing well. I've been thinking a lot about you lately and really miss you. It feels like something's missing without you around.

I would love to see you again and spend some time together. How about we go out on a date? We could have a nice meal or do something fun,just let me know what sounds good to you.

Looking forward to hearing from you and hoping we can catch up soon.

With love,

[nyenyenye]
